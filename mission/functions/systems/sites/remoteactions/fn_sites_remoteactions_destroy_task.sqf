	Description:
		Destroys a site's asset based on the type of asset, via the `destroy_task` holdAction

		This runs server side. It needs to do several client side remoteExecs to:
		- remove the player's explosive mag from inventory
		- set up the fire light/particle sources for burning a shelter
		- Send various paradigm notifications to players

		Currently implemented:
		- Burning shelters at campsites
		- Destroying dac cong respawns
		- Blowing up a paradigm built building
		- Blowing up a basic object, like an ammo crate or a mortar
	
	Parameter(s):
		- _task - the object that needs to be destroyed (player is looking at)
		- _player - player doing the destroying
	
	Returns:
	
	Example(s):
		[_object, _player] call vn_mf_fnc_sites_remoteactions_destroy_task;
