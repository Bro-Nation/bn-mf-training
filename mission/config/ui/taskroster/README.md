# `config/ui/taskroster`

Configures the **main** display pages for the task roster UI system.

Configs with a name like `ui_tr_display_*.hpp` configure the full task roster layout, including the left hand side page.

Anything in `ui_tr_def_ctrls.hpp` configures things on the right hand side page ONLY.

Should hopefully be obvious that the `ui_tr_display_main.hpp` configures the initial page loaded for all players.
